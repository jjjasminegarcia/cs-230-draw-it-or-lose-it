1. Briefly summarize The Gaming Room client and their software requirements.
The Gaming Room is a company that wanted to create a web-based version of their successful mobile game: Draw It or Lose It. In their request for a web-based version of the game, they required the software to be compatible across multiple platforms, with Java being used for deployment. Additionally, they requested that the program supports multiple teams and players, making sure that only one instance of the game is running at a time. 

2. What did you do particularly well in developing this documentation?
I think I did particularly well in organizing the software design document in a clear manner, ensuring that each section was easy to follow, even if the reader didn't have much technical experience. This included the requirements, constraints, evaluation, and the recommendations. Also, I gave detailed explanations, in hopes that both the client and future developers could understand the design intentions.

3. What about the process of working through a design document did you find helpful when developing the code?
When developing the code, I felt the design document made it much simpler for me to stay organized and look ahead at what was next on my to do list. It allowed me to process how the game might work across different platforms, how users would interact with the system, and how data would be stored, before any coding even began on my end.

4. If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?
If I could choose one part of my work to revise, I would probably improve the Domain Model portion. I might consider adding visual diagrams or real-world examples to ensure it's easier to understand how the players, teams, and games relate to each other.

5. How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your software design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?
I interpreted the user's needs by reviewing the client's request for functionality across multiple platforms, single game instance, and secure storage. I kept checking in with myself to make sure the design choices, such as Linux and MySQL databases, were adding support to these client requirements. I feel that it's important to make sure the user's needs come first, because the design must solve the user's problems to ensure a smooth, secure, and ultimately fun experience.

6. How did you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a similar software application?
I approached designing software by making sure I understood the requirements and matched each one to a technical solution. Moving forward, I will likely continue using this strategy. However, I would also incorporate detailed diagrams to help visualize the system earlier in the design process.
